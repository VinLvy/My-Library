# My Library App

A simple web application for managing and displaying a personal book library. Users can add new books, toggle their read status, and remove them from the list. This project showcases HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features, including DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Features

- **Add New Book**: Users can add new books to the library by filling out a form with the book's title, author, number of pages, and reading status.
- **Display Books**: Books are displayed in a clean table format, where each book has its title, author, pages, and current reading status visible.
- **Remove Books**: Each book entry includes a button to remove the book from the library.
- **Update Read Status**: Users can toggle the reading status of each book between "Read", "Unread", and "Currently Reading".
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be mobile-friendly with responsive layout and scalable styling.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Used to structure the layout of the page.
- **CSS**: Styled using modern CSS features for a clean, responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: The core logic is written in vanilla JavaScript, enabling dynamic updates, form handling, and event-driven interactions.

## Usage

### Adding a Book
1. Click on the **Add book** button at the top of the page.
2. A form will appear, asking for the book's details (title, author, pages, and status).
3. Fill in the form and click **Save** to add the book to the library.

### Removing a Book
- Each book listed in the table has a red **Remove** button. Click the button to remove the book from the library.

### Toggling Book Read Status
- The reading status of a book can be changed by clicking the toggle button next to the status column. This updates the current reading status.
